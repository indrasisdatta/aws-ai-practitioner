Supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised - when to use what
Sagemaker services (Clarify, Model monitor, Jumpstart, Data Wrangler)
Sagemaker model cards, AI service cards 
Sagemaker model dashboard 
Sagemaker model monitor
Amazon Augmented A2I
Top P, Top K, Temperature (1 causes hallucination)
You can use a customized model only in provisioned throughput mode 
Amazon Inspector - automated security assessment service

------- KEY AREAS -------

Prompt Management
. What is to be included in Few shot examples
. Image not created as per prompt. How to improve the same?
. Different response required for different age groups. How to manage that? Training or prompt management.

Security
. Guardrails
. Choose the use case in which client will have maximum level of security ownership
· VPC endpoint for S3
· Private Link
. How to mitigate potential fraud attacks from an IP address

Inference - 1
· To get more consistent response - should we reduce or increase temperature
· Knowledge bases and RAG
. Identify the activity which happens in Inference
· RAG pipeline - activities done through offline batch processing

Inference - 2
· Asynchronous inference
. Evaluation metrics - BLEU and BERT Score
. For interactive low latency inferences, which method we will use? 
  (real time hosting, asynchronous, batch inferences)
  
Pricing
. What impacts price of an FM model
. When there is no consistent workload and client don't want to give any long-term commitments, which pricing method to
use? OnDemand or Provisioned Throughput  

Training - 1
· Unlabeled data to be used for improving the model. Which method to use? 
  (Continued pretraining / fine tuning / prompt engineering.)
. Domain adaptation
. Decision trees can improve transparency in ML models - how classification decision was made.
. Identify the use case as supervised/unsupervised/reinforcement learning

Training - 2
. Which instance type has less environmental impact
. GAN - Generative adversarial Network use case
· Exploratory data analysis vs feature engineering
. How to improve overall accuracy during training
. Chatbot - continuous improvement based on client feedback. Which training method will you use?
